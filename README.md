> _The unruly Moorish tribe rages against its own flesh, the Goths utterly destroy the Burgundians, and again the Alamanni wear arms for the conquered, and the Tervingi too, ... with the help of a band of Taifali join battle with the Vandals and Gepids. ... The Burgundians have taken over the land of the Alamanni, but obtained at great cost to themselves. The Alamanni have lost the land but seek to regain it._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— [Genethliacus of Maximian Augustus, Panegyrici Latini XI, 17](https://www.jassa.org/?p=7497)

> _House against house, town against town; if you see a man, knock him down._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Traditional (from the rules of the [Haxey Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haxey_Hood), a rough English 'folk football' game)

The year is 499. In the west, the Roman Empire is a patchwork of barbarian successor states. In the east, it lives on as Byzantium, still a force to be reckoned with. Who will survive? Who will triumph? What even is triumph anyway?

## Credits

Thanks to Lovable AI for helping me whip up the initial prototype in a day (including the map and some of the chronicler images), and to ChatGPT for massive help and encouragement over the rest of the month that it took me till I had something ready to deploy. Salutes too to AI genius of last resort, Claude.

AI images mainly from Copilot, with a few from Chat.

The Vandal name generator owes a lot to Nicholetta Francovich Onesti's "[Tracing the language of the Vandals](https://www.academia.edu/691311/Tracing_the_Language_of_the_Vandals)". Goti e Vandali. Rome: Artemide. pp. 179–195, and "[The Language and Names of the Vandals](https://www.academia.edu/1516556/THE_LANGUAGE_AND_NAMES_OF_THE_VANDALS)", Das Konigreich der Vandalen: Erben des Imperiums in Nordafrika, Karlsruhe 2009.

Thematic inspiration: Herbert F. Bushman's [The Dark Ages Podcast](https://darkagespod.com/), which I listened to night and day this month. I fell asleep listening to it, and it got into my dreams.

I must also credit Lovable with one of the jokes. I'll let you guess which.
